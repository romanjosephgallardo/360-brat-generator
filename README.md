# 360 BRAT Generator

![360 BRAT Generator Preview](assets/images/360_brat_generator_photo.png)

Inspired by Charli xcxâ€™s [bratgenerator.com](https://www.bratgenerator.com/), **360 brat generator** features an
improved layout with dynamic features, allowing users 
to customize background and text colors. '360' 
represents its ability to customize the generator at all
aspects *(colors)* and of course, Charli's iconic intro for BRAT album 360.

## Features
- Customizable background and text colors using RGB, HSL, and Hex Code.
- Multi-line text support (up to 6 lines).
- Responsive design.
- Improved BRAT font (90% stretched text and blurred visual).

## Purpose
Personally, I built this project to familiarize and strengthen the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the other hand, the idea was to make customizing BRAT fonts easier without using image editors such as Photoshop or PicsArt. This project also serves as a portfolio piece to showcase alongside our other work.
This project helped me practice clean, interactive design and improve my web development skills.  Iâ€™m looking for ways to enhance the app and grow further as programmer.

Example usage:
<br>
E=MCÂ² *(Studio Album by Mariah Carey)*            |  E=MCÂ² in BRAT style
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="assets/images/EMC2_Artwork.jpg" width="400" alt="E=MC2"/>  |  <img src="assets/images/EMC2.png" width="400" alt="E=MC2 in BRAT style"/>
